#Library Management System

This is a simple Library Management System implemented in Java. It allows users to search for books by category, reserve books, buy books, and return books. The system consists of three main components: LibreriaModel (the model), LibreriaView (the view), and LibreriaController (the controller). The model represents the data and provides methods for accessing and manipulating it. The view handles the user interface and displays information to the user. The controller handles the logic and coordinates the interaction between the model and the view.
